# Hi there, and welcome to my repository 👋
I'm Adedotun, but most people called me **Ade** (pronounced 🔉 * *Ah-day* *).

## What exactly do I do? 🤔
+ I code 💻
+ I play tennis 🎾
+ I study 👨‍🎓
+ I also do a few other things, but 3 is more than enough for you to know. Quit being so nosey 😝

***I've created this repository to build up my portfolio as I aspire to become a Data Scientist***
